# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to COVID Shield!

Weâ€™d love to get your issues (if you find any bugs) and PRs (if you have any fixes)!

First, please review this document and the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Reporting security issues

COVID Shield takes security very seriously. In the interest of coordinated disclosure,
we request that any potential vulnerabilities be reported privately in accordance with
our [security policy](SECURITY.md).

## Contributing documentation and non-code changes

If you'd like to contribute a documentation or static file change, please
feel free to fork the project in GitHub and open a PR from that fork against
this repository.

## Contributing code

If you'd like to contribute code changes, the following steps will help you
setup a local development environment. If you're a Shopify employee, `dev up`
will install the above dependencies and `dev {build,test,run,etc.}` will work
as you'd expect.

Once you're happy with your changes, please fork the repository and push your
code to your fork, then open a PR against this repository.

### Prerequisites

* Go (tested with 1.14)
* Ruby (tested with 2.7.1)
* Bundler
* [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) (tested with libprotoc 3.11.4)
* [protoc-gen-go](https://github.com/golang/protobuf) (may only be needed to change `proto/*`)
* libsodium
* docker-compose
* MySQL

### Building

Run `make` or `make release` to build a release version of the servers.

### Running

```bash
# example...
export DATABASE_URL="root@tcp(localhost)/covidshield"
export KEY_CLAIM_TOKEN=thisisatoken=ON

./key-retrieval migrate-db

PORT=8000 ./key-submission
PORT=8001 ./key-retrieval
```

### Running Tests

If you're at Shopify, `dev up` will configure the database for you. If not
you will need to point to your database server using the environment variables
(note that the database will be clobbered so ensure that you don't point to a
production database):

```shell
$ export DB_USER=<username>
$ export DB_PASS=<password>
$ export DB_HOST=<hostname>
$ export DB_NAME=<test database name>
```

Then, ensure the appropriate requirements are installed:

```shell
$ bundle install
```

Finally, run:
```shell
$ make test
```

# Developer Setup for macOS

If you're at Shopify, it's probably best that you follow the setup instructions above. For external folks that wish to build/run locally on macOS, here's instructions.

This has been tested with the following environment:

- macOS 10.15.4
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

## Setup Dependencies

### Install Go Lang

The application has been tested with the Go programming language at version 1.14.x. This installs that version explicitly.

`brew install go@1.14`

### Install Ruby

This sets up your Mac to run version 2.7.1 of Ruby, which is what the application has been tested at as of writing.

1. Install OpenSSL: `brew install openssl`
1. Install Rbenv: `brew install rbenv ruby-build`
1. Add the following to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file:
    ``` 
    RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--with-openssl-dir=$(brew --prefix openssl)"`
    `eval "$(rbenv init -)"
    ```
1. Restart your terminal
1. Install Ruby 2.6.5: `rbenv install 2.6.5`
1. Move into the clone of this repo
1. Set the version of Ruby to 2.6.5: `rbenv local 2.6.5` (this will drop the file `.ruby-version`)
1. Install Bundler: `gem install bundler`

### Install Protocol Buffers

`brew install protobuf`

### Install Protocol Buffer Generator for Go

`brew install protoc-gen-go`

### Install Sodium

`brew install libsodium`

### Install Docker

(Note: The latest release of Docker for Desktop has some issues on macOS 10.15.4. These instructions install a prior version.)

1. Go to the [Docker for Mac Stable release notes](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/release-notes/)
1. Download Docker Desktop Community 2.2.0.5.
1. Copy the `Docker.app` file to `/Applications`
1. Run `Docker.app`

### Install MySQL Build Dependencies

These are needed for automated tests.

1. Install MySQL client (for its header files): `brew install mysql`
1. Install Ruby driver: `gem install mysql2 -- --with-cflags=\"-I/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/include\" --with-ldflags=\"-L/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib\"`

## Run Database (in Docker)

This runs a MySQL database at `localhost` on port `3306` with a DB root user password of `somepasswordhere`. As of writing, this is MySQL 8.x.

1. Go into the cloned copy of this repo
1. Create file for MySQL data files: `mkdir mysql-data`
1. Run MySQL: `docker run -it --rm -p 3306:3306 --name covidshield-db -v $PWD/mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=somepasswordhere -d mysql`

## Build CovidShield Server

1. Go into the cloned copy of this repo
1. Run the build: `make`

This will place built files into `./build/release`.

## Setup the Database

1. Setup some dev environment variables: `source scripts/dev_env_vars.sh`
1. Setup the database: `./build/release/key-retrieval migrate-db`

This will leave up the Key Retrieval server running at `http://localhost:8001`. You should see something like:

```

```

Kill it with `CTRL+C` after you see the above.

## Run the Servers
